# Customer-Rating-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
echnologies and Tools: Python, Linear Regression, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Amazon Dataset

#**Description:**
Conducted research to develop a Machine Learning model capable of predicting customer ratings based on product reviews. Utilized the "Rating" and "Review" features from an Amazon-sampled dataset to predict future customer ratings. Explored three machine learning algorithms—Linear Regression, Naïve Bayes, and Random Forest—and evaluated their performance in forecasting customer sentiment.
